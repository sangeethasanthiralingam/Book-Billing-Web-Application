## 4. ADVANCED GIT TECHNIQUES

### **1. Interactive Rebase for Clean History**
```bash
# Clean up commit history before merging
git checkout feature/new-feature
git rebase -i develop

# Interactive rebase session example:
pick a1b2c3d feat: implement basic functionality
squash e4f5g6h fix: minor bug in implementation
reword h7i8j9k feat: add comprehensive tests and documentation
pick k0l1m2n docs: update API documentation
drop l3m4n5o temp: debugging code (remove this commit)

# Result: Clean, meaningful commit history
```

### **2. Git Hooks for Quality Assurance**
```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
echo "Running pre-commit quality checks..."

# Run unit tests
mvn test -q
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Unit tests failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi

# Check code style
mvn checkstyle:check -q
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Code style check failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi

# Check for TODO/FIXME comments in production code
if grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" src/main/java/; then
    echo "⚠️ TODO/FIXME comments found in production code."
    echo "Please resolve before committing."
    exit 1
fi

# Security scan
mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check -q
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Security vulnerabilities detected. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ All pre-commit checks passed."
```

### **3. Advanced Merging Strategies**
```bash
# Squash merge for feature branches
git checkout develop
git merge --squash feature/new-feature
git commit -m "feat: implement comprehensive new feature

Complete implementation including:
- Core functionality with error handling
