## 8. ADVANCED GIT TECHNIQUES

### **1. Interactive Rebase for Clean History**
```bash
# Clean up commit history before merging
git checkout feature/new-feature
git rebase -i develop

# Interactive rebase options:
# pick: use commit as-is
# reword: change commit message
# edit: modify commit
# squash: combine with previous commit
# fixup: like squash but discard commit message
# drop: remove commit

# Example rebase session:
pick a1b2c3d feat: implement basic functionality
squash e4f5g6h fix: minor bug in implementation
reword h7i8j9k feat: add comprehensive tests
pick k0l1m2n docs: update documentation
```

### **2. Git Hooks for Quality Assurance**
```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
echo "Running pre-commit checks..."

# Run tests
mvn test -q
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Tests failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi

# Check code style
mvn checkstyle:check -q
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Code style check failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi

# Check for TODO comments in production code
if grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" src/main/java/; then
    echo "TODO/FIXME comments found in production code. Please resolve before committing."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Pre-commit checks passed."
```

### **3. Git Submodules for Shared Components**
```bash
# Add shared utilities as submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/company/shared-utilities.git lib/shared-utilities
git commit -m "feat: add shared utilities submodule"

# Update submodules
git submodule update --remote
git commit -m "chore: update shared utilities to latest version"
```

### **4. Advanced Merging Strategies**
```bash
# Squash merge for feature branches
git checkout develop
git merge --squash feature/new-feature
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature with comprehensive testing

- Add new functionality with proper error handling
- Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Update documentation and examples
- Ensure backward compatibility

Squashed commits from feature/new-feature:
- Initial implementation
- Add tests
- Fix edge cases
- Update documentation"

# No-fast-forward merge for release branches
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release/v1.4.0
git tag -a v1.4.0 -m "Release v1.4.0"
```

git log --format='%aN' | sort -u | wc -l     # Contributors: 3
git log --since="1 month ago" --oneline | wc -l  # Recent activity: 45 commits

# Code contribution analysis
git log --format='%aN' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
# Output:
#   85 Sangeetha Santhiralingam
#   35 Development Team
#   30 Code Reviewer

# File change frequency
git log --name-only --pretty=format: | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10
```

### **2. Branch Analysis**
```bash
# Active branches
git branch -r
# Output:
#   origin/main
#   origin/develop
#   origin/feature/enhanced-reporting
#   origin/hotfix/security-patch
#   origin/release/v2.1.0

# Merged branches (cleaned up)

git push --mirror
```

### **2. Branch Recovery**
```bash
# Recover accidentally deleted branch
git reflog                           # Find commit hash
git checkout -b recovered-branch <commit-hash>
git push origin recovered-branch

# Recover from force push
git reflog origin/main               # Find previous state
git reset --hard <previous-commit>
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### **3. Data Recovery Procedures**
```bash
# Recover specific file from history
git log --follow -- path/to/file.java
git checkout <commit-hash> -- path/to/file.java
